# Attempting A Problem (Udacity)

## Understand the Problem (Computational)

A problem is defined by a __set of possible inputs__ (could be infinite), __desired output(s)__, and the __relationship between inputs and outputs__.

A solution to a problem is a __procedure__ that takes the inputs and produces the output.

## Rule Zero - Never Panic

If you panic, you can't figure out the problem

## First Step - Understand the Inputs (What Are The Inputs)?

Are the inputs valid?

How are inputs represented?

## What Are The Outputs?

## What's the Relationship - Show Some Examples

## Solve the Problem

Solve it as a human.
Write down as an algorithm how you'd solve it as a human (brute force).

Try to develop a simple mechanical solution (don't optimize prematurely)
